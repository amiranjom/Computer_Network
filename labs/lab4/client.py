# Class: Computer Networks
# Date: 02/03/2020
# Lab3: TCP Client Socket
# Goal: Learning Networking in Python with TCP sockets
# Student Name: Amir R. Anjomshoaa
# Student ID: 918710278
# Student Github Username: amiranjom
# Instructions: Read each problem carefully, and implement them correctly. Your grade in labs is based on passing
#               all the unit tests provided.
#               No partial credit will be given. Labs must be completed in class, and must be commited to your
#               personal repository by 9:45 pm on iLearn.
